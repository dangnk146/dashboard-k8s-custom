# Dashboard arguments

Dashboard container accepts multiple arguments that can be used to customize it a bit. For example, we are using `--auto-generate-certificates` flag in our recommended setup [YAML files](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml) to pass certificates to Dashboard.
